# Flying Wing

The goal of the project is to engineer a small flying wing capable of autonomous flight. In a second phase the goal will be to implement a mission like biome recognition and environment monitoring. It is mainly a learning project which aim to familiarize ourselves with embedded linux development, electronics desing, flight mechanics, mecanical engineering and machine learning. 

# Phase 1 : Platform

ToDo :
- [ ] Design effective and simple flying wing using basic materials. Option 2 : Choose an off the shelf base diy flying wing/plane.
- [ ] Implement motors and servos.
- [ ] Design the flight computer based on esp32.
- [ ] Produce flight computer and develop flight software.
- [ ] Implement manual controlled flight.
- [ ] Implement autonomous flight.

# Phase 2 : Mission
